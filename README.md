# SwiftFlash

**SwiftFlash** is a lightweight, native macOS application for flashing `.iso` file to a external drive . Built with SwiftUI and Swift 6, SwiftFlash aims to be a minimal, safe, and open-source alternative to tools like balenaEtcher or Raspberry Pi Imager.

‚ö°Ô∏è **Simple. Safe. Swift.**

## Key Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Native macOS Interface** - Built with SwiftUI for seamless integration and a very small app size (just around 4MB)
- üìÅ **Drag & Drop Support** - Simply drag your image file onto the app
- üíæ **Device Inventory** - Tracks and remembers your external drives (e.g. USB sticks, SD Cards ...)
    - The app provide and inventory of all externale devices and the user can define a name and a type.
    - A automatic type detection is for the moment not possibe as related informaton are missing. 
     **SHA256 Checksum** - Generate and store integrity checksums
- **LocalAuthentication** to provide access to root rights (flash is only possible under root)


## Supported File Formats

- `.iso` - ISO disk images

## System Requirements

- **macOS**: 15.6 or later
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon (ARM64) or Intel (x86_64)


## Installation

### Download
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/SwiftFlash/releases) page.

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SwiftFlash.git
cd SwiftFlash
xcodebuild -project SwiftFlash/SwiftFlash.xcodeproj -scheme SwiftFlash -configuration Release build
```

## Usage

1. **Select Image File** - Drag and drop your image file, or use the file picker 
3. **Choose Target Drive** - Select the external drive from the list of available drives
5. **Start Flashing** - Click "Flash", confirm  and wait for completion 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Flashing will erase all data on the target drive, therefore this requires root rights. 

## SHA256 Checksum Verification

SwiftFlash includes built-in SHA256 checksum functionality to ensure file integrity and verify downloaded images.

## Safety Features

- **Sandboxing**: Sandboxing is for the moment disabled as the access to flash drive require root rights. 
- **Drive Validation** - Only removable drives are shown as targets
- **System Drive Protection** - System drives are automatically excluded
- **Confirmation Dialogs** - Multiple confirmation steps before flashing
- **Read-only Detection** - Warns about read-only drives

## Development

### Coding Standards

- **Language**: Swift 6
- **Target**: macOS 15.6+
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Binary Size**: Optimized for minimal footprint
- **Documentation**: Function-level comments and key step documentation
- **Dependencies**: Prefer system libraries over third-party dependencies
- **APIs**: Use latest libraries and avoid deprecated interfaces
