# SwiftFlash

**SwiftFlash** is a lightweight, native macOS application for flashing `.img` and `.iso` files to USB drives.  
Built with SwiftUI and Swift 6, SwiftFlash aims to be a minimal, safe, and open-source alternative to bulky tools like balenaEtcher or Raspberry Pi Imager which are quit big.



### Features
- Native macOS interface (SwiftUI)
- Drag & drop image support
- Lists connected removable drives
- Built-in safety checks to prevent flashing to the wrong disk
- Open Source (MIT License)

⚡️ Simple. Safe. Swift.
