# Cursor Rules for SwiftFlash Project
# These rules apply to ALL AI models working on this project

## CRITICAL: Code Protection Rules
- **NEVER** modify code marked with "DO NOT MODIFY" comments
- **NEVER** change sections marked with "CRITICAL" or "TESTED AND VERIFIED"
- **ALWAYS** ask for permission before modifying protected code sections
- **RESPECT** all protection markers: `// MARK: - CRITICAL ... (DO NOT MODIFY)`
- **IGNORE** files or sections marked with `// AI-IGNORE-START` / `// AI-IGNORE-END`

## Protected Code Sections
The following areas are protected and should NOT be modified without explicit permission:

### Data Models (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `Drive` struct in DriveModel.swift
- `ImageFile` struct in ImageFileModel.swift  
- `DeviceInventoryItem` struct in DeviceInventory.swift
- `DeviceType` enum in DeviceInventory.swift
- `ImageFileType` enum in ImageFileModel.swift

### Core Services (DO NOT MODIFY)
- `ImageFlashService` class in ImageFlashService.swift
- `FlashError` enum in ImageFlashService.swift
- `DriveDetectionService` class in DriveDetectionService.swift

### UI Components (DO NOT MODIFY)
- Main ScrollView layout in ContentView.swift
- Inspector area layout in ContentView.swift
- App structure in SwiftFlashApp.swift

### Critical Functionality (DO NOT MODIFY)
- Device detection logic
- Flash operation safety checks
- Error handling mechanisms
- Data persistence logic

## General Development Rules
- **FOCUS** only on the specific task requested
- **DON'T** change unrelated UI components or data structures
- **TEST** any changes thoroughly before suggesting them
- **DOCUMENT** any modifications clearly
- **ASK** if unsure about any changes

## When Modification is Necessary
If changes to protected sections are absolutely required:
1. **EXPLAIN** why the change is necessary
2. **ASK** for explicit permission
3. **SUGGEST** alternative approaches first
4. **WARN** about potential side effects
5. **TEST** thoroughly after changes

## File-Specific Rules
- **ContentView.swift**: UI layout is protected, only modify toolbar and non-layout components
- **Data Models**: Structure and properties are protected, only add new computed properties if needed
- **Services**: Core logic is protected, only add new methods or improve existing ones
- **App Structure**: Main app setup is protected, only add new scenes if needed

## Error Prevention
- **CHECK** for protection markers before making any changes
- **VERIFY** that changes don't affect protected sections
- **CONFIRM** with user before proceeding with risky changes
- **ROLLBACK** if changes cause issues with protected code

Remember: This project has critical functionality for device flashing. Safety and stability are paramount.
